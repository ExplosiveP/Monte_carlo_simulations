# Two-dice-with-n-re-roll

In this simulation, we are solving the following question:
Roll two dice, and you have a chance to reroll 1 dice if you want. Sum up the numbers of the two dice, what is the probability of each situation, and what is the expected number under that situation?

The EV for one dice is 3.5.
Therefore, if one of the dice has the value of less than 3.5, which is 1-3, we would re-roll the dice.
